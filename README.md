A light and fun project for myself (that others might use) as a tin whistler that gathers tab sheets in one place, the pictures are saved and can be printed later on.
There's an admin log-in screen that allows deletion and adding to the data-base.

### What i've learned?
Using cloudinary and tailwind-css.

### Technologies used:

* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Cloudinary
* Tailwind CSS


### About the project and myself:
This project gathers music tabs for the flute (that I upload) and was developed for fun so I could learn tailwind-css.
As somebody who plays the tin whistle frequently I thought it would be really useful to have all of the sheets in one place.
